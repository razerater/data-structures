TEST CASE SUMMARY:
How did your program perform on the different test cases?  Summarize
the running times.  (It's ok if it didn't finish the harder examples.)
What new test cases did you create and how did it perform on those
tests?

My program ran relatively quickly on each test case. Not one ran longer
than 3 seconds. I created a test case that was a modification of puzzle1
so that there would be no solutions.
